# How does it work?

Theer are few things you need to know before you start using `hookform-input`.

## Input type

To achieve maximum compatibility with UI libraries `FormInput` is making usage of **controlled** version of input via `useController` hook and/or\* `Context API` exposed by `react-hook-form`.

As everything in apart of some pros there are also cons coming with each decision:

Pros:

- more flexible API
- you can use **_any_** component that supports `value` and `onChange` props (or their equivalents) as `input` prop.

Cons:

- using `FormProvider` might lead to potential [performance issues](https://www.react-hook-form.com/advanced-usage/#FormProviderPerformance) in more complex forms due to more re-renders\*

</p>

## Smart & Polymorphic approach ðŸ§ 

Have you heard about [Smart components](https://react-hook-form.com/advanced-usage#SmartFormComponent)?

It's really cool approach - **_magic ðŸª„_** just happens.

Main purpose of this project is to make this pattern easy to integrate with your current codebase by combining **_polymoprhic_** and **_Smart Component_** approaches.

### Polymorphic components

In a few words, it is a component that lets us specify which React element we want to use for its root. If youâ€™ve used some UI library, such as [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) or [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), youâ€™ve already encountered a polymorphic component.

### Smart components

According to `react-hook-form` docs:

_"This idea here is that you can easily compose your form with inputs."_

However, it's not that easy to achieve in a real-world application. This package is here to help you with that.
The [example from the docs](https://react-hook-form.com/advanced-usage#SmartFormComponent) is working perfectly fine but has some limitations eg. doesn't supports nested component fields.
Another problem is lack of **typescript** support for `name` field which is really annoying.
