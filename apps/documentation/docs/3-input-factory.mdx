# Input factory

You might not want to pass `input` prop manually all the time over and over again.
Especially when you work in larger projects with a lot of forms.
Probably you have some kind of `Input` component that you use in your forms or that is coming from a UI library of your choice.

This is why we have a factory function that allows you to create a new component with predefined `input` prop.

## Usage

```tsx
import { createFormInput, createFormInputBare } from "hookform-input";


const TextInput = /* some code */

const TextFormInput = createFormInput(TextInput)
const TextFormInputBare = createFormInputBare(TextInput)
```

Each of factory functions accepts `input` component as a parameter and returns a `FormInput` component with predefined `input` prop.

Rest of the API is the same as for `FormInput` and `FormInputBare` components.
