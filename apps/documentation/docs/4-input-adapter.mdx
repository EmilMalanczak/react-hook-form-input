# Input adapter

To make integration with different UI libraries easier, you can use the `formInputAdapters` object to register custom input adapters.
It is simple implementation of Adapter Pattern that allows you to transform the props passed to the `hookform-input` component to match the expected format of the UI library or your actual components that you are using without unnessesary refactor or adjustments.

## API

`formInputAdapters` exposes a single method `register` that accepts an object with the following properties:

- `key` - a unique key that identifies the adapter
- `transformFn` - a function that accepts the props passed to the `hookform-input` component and the original props and returns the transformed props

There is preregistered adapter that is used by default - `_default`. It cuts down some of the data that is passed from `hookform-input` to the input component related to the field state and form state coming from the `react-hook-form` library.
While most of the reusable components are using spread operator to pass the props to the input component it could be a problem spread a whole `formState` object on the html tag.

#### Ignored props:

- `fieldState` - state of input which might be useful for some additional UI styles / validation logic. It contains:

type definition for the `fieldState` object:

```ts
type ControllerFieldState = {
  invalid: boolean;
  isTouched: boolean;
  isDirty: boolean;
  isValidating: boolean;
  error?: FieldError;
};
```

- `formState` - whole state of the form context that the input is rendered in
- `field` - object containing all the input props eg. `onChange`, `name`

### Default adapater implementation

```tsx
formInputAdapters.register({
  key: "_default",
  transformFn: ({ field, fieldState, formState, ...inputProps }) => inputProps,
});
```

## Usage

For example if you are using a Material UI library - [`TextField`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-text-field/) component receives slightly different props than `hookform-input` provides.

We pass `error` as a string meant to be used as an error message, but Material UI expects it a boolean and the message is passed additionally as a `helperText`.
To make this work, we can register an adapter that transforms the props to match the expected format.

```tsx
import { formInputAdapters } from "hookform-input";

formInputAdapters.register({
  key: "MUI-TextField",
  transformFn: (props, originalProps) => ({
    ...props,
    error: !!props.error,
    helperText: props.error ?? originalProps?.description,
  }),
});
```

Now, when you use the `hookform-input` with the `MUI-TextField` key, the props will be transformed to match the expected format.

```tsx
import TextField from "@mui/material/TextField";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

const Component = () => {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      text: "some value",
    },
  });

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={format.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <FormInputBare
        name="text"
        input={TextField}
        adapterKey="MUI-TextField"
        control={form.control}
      />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```
