# Shadcn UI

Integration with Material UI is a bit more complex than with Mantine. To make usage of `error` message, you have to provide a custom component that will handle it correctly. This is bare minimum example of how to use `hookform-input` with Material UI components.

```tsx
<Sandbox
  name="Material UI codesandbox"
  source="https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-7lkofe?embed=1&file=src%2Fapp.tsx"
/>
```
