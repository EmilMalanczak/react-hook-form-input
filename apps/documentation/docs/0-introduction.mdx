# Introduction

Typesafe and simple implementation of polymorphic _Smart component_ component for `react-hook-form` package.

## Motivation

If you are here I suppose you use `react-hook-form` to work with your forms. Have you heard about [Smart components](https://react-hook-form.com/advanced-usage#SmartFormComponent)? It's really cool approach - **_magic 🪄_** just happens.

Main purpose of this project is to make this pattern easy to integrate with your current codebase by combining **_polymoprhic_** and **_Smart Component_** approaches.

## Installation

`hookform-input` is available as an NPM package:

<Tabs className="tabs">
<TabItem value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm add hookform-input
````
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">
```bash
yarn add hookform-input
````
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm">
```bash
npm install hookform-input
````
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info

This package is an extension to `react-hook-form` so you need to have it pre-installed

Bare minimum to start with!

```tsx
import { FormInput } from "hookform-input";
import { FormProvider, useForm } from "react-hook-form";

const NameForm = () => {
  const form = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (values) => {
    console.log(values);
  };

  return (
    <FormProvider {...formData}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        <FormInput name="username" />
